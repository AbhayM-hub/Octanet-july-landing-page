              <h4>Kapaleshwar temple</h4>
              <p>
                Kapaleshwar Mandir in Nashik is the temple of Lord Shiva. 
                This is an unusual temple unlike the other Shiva temples because there is no statue Nandi, 
                the Gatekeeper of Lord Shiva. The temple was the place where Lord Shiva performed atonement after taking a dip in RamKund to wash off his Sin. 
                As Lord Shiva regarded Nandi as a Guru or Teacher, 
                there is no statue in the temple to guard the Kapaleshwar Temple.
                Kapaleshwar Mandir Nashik Timings:
                Morning – 5:00 AM to 12:00 PM
                Evening- 4:00 PM to 9:00 PM
                <b>Kapaleshwar Mandir History:</b>
                Lord Shiva mistakenly killed a cow then Nandi told Shiva to take a bath in Ramkund, Nashik.
                 As per the instructions of Nandi, Lord Shiva took a scared dip in the RamKund and meditated for some time. 
                 The present temple is located at the same place where Lord Shiva meditated.
